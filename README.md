## Getting Started

### Database Setup

The application uses a PostgreSQL database. The connection details configured by default in `backend/src/db.js` are:
- **Database Name:** `omundoasuaporta_db`
- **Host:** `localhost`
- **Port:** `5432`
- **User:** `postgres`
- **Password:** (See `backend/src/db.js` - default is 'your_password')

You will need to manually create the database `omundoasuaporta_db` in your PostgreSQL instance before starting the backend. For example, using `psql`:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE omundoasuaporta_db;
```

**Table Creation:**
No scripts for creating tables were found in the repository. You may need to create the tables manually based on application requirements or by inspecting the backend code if they are not created automatically by the application upon startup.

**Important Security Note:**
The default password in `backend/src/db.js` is a placeholder (`'your_password'`). For any environment, especially production, ensure you change this password to a strong, unique password. It is highly recommended to configure database credentials using environment variables as commented in `backend/src/db.js` (e.g., `PGUSER`, `PGHOST`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGDATABASE`, `PGPORT`).

### Backend

To start the backend server, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
The backend server will typically be running on port 3001 or as specified in the application.

### Frontend

To start the frontend development server, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `o-mundo-a-sua-porta-frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd o-mundo-a-sua-porta-frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
This will typically open the application in your default web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
